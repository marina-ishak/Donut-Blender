This is my first Blender project, a basic model of a donut, created by following the popular Donut Tutorial by Blender Guru on YouTube. It serves as a starting point to showcase my progress and learning in Blender.
## Project Description
The Blender Donut Project is a 3D model created using Blender, following the step-by-step instructions provided in the Donut Tutorial by Blender Guru. The project focuses on teaching the fundamentals of Blender, including modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering. The result is a realistic-looking donut with icing and sprinkles.

## Features
- Basic 3D model of a donut with icing and sprinkles
- Realistic materials and textures applied to the model
- Proper lighting setup to enhance the overall look of the scene
- Rendered animation showcasing the final result of the project
## Getting Started
To explore or work with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have Blender installed on your computer. The project was created using Blender 3.4.1.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

3. **Open the Project**: Open Blender and select "Open" or "Open Recent". Navigate to the project directory and select the file containing the Blender Donut Project.

4. **Explore the Scene**: The project file contains the 3D scene with the donut model, materials, and lighting setup. Feel free to navigate the scene, inspect the model, and modify any aspects as desired.
## Future Improvements
This project is a stepping stone for learning Blender, which I will use in my graduation project to create an AI character therapist for interactive conversations. Potential future enhancements include:

Adding more elements: Add objects or elements to build a more complex scene.
Experimenting with textures: Customize the look with different textures, shaders, and materials.
Advanced techniques: Explore Blenderâ€™s advanced features like animation, physics simulations, and character modeling.
Incorporating in larger projects: Use this donut model in larger scenes or projects.
Portfolio sharing: Share renders or animations on social media or portfolio sites to document progress.
